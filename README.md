Code written for a test given to me by Needle

The code files in this repo correlate with their file name and the test question written below:

1) Write a program that will count the most used word in a file.  It should accept the name of a file to read from and print 
out the word that was most common along with the number of times that word appeared in the file.  Ignore case, and all 
whitespace, commas, and periods.  

2) Write a program that will accept a zipfile and prints out all of the file names and their sizes.  For example, if I were to
zip the directory “Dropbox” and give the name to the program it should print out the following: 

          cloudapi.zip 2.4MB 
          Calculus Textbook.pdf 869 bytes
          Engravings of Wraith.doc 4.2MB 
          Getting Started.pdf 2.3MB 
          Crt.py 3.2KB 
          Crtkp.py 3.2KB 
          Getinfo.py 3.9KB 
          …. 
          Ebs_uw_results.txt 5.2KB
          Instance_uw_results.txt 2.2KB 
          …. 
          Snapshots_results.txt 1.2KB

3. Write a program that takes in a decimal whole number and returns the number in hex and binary.

4. Write a program that accepts a file input and assigns a numerical value position to a letter in the alphabet (ignoring case)
and adds up the total of each letter in a sentence, printing out the sentence and value with the highest numerical value.  It 
should ignore any numbers, spaces, and special characters (‘$’,  ‘!’, ‘-‘, etc.).  For example, the word “green” would have 
the values of 7+18+5+5+14= 49.  And given the following paragraph:

a. The car is green.  The nightingale sang in N.Y.C. but not in Chicago in 2015.  Let’s talk about the zucchini. 

The first sentence would have a value of 132, the second is 429, and the third is 285.  Therefore the program would print out:

The nightingale sang in N.Y.C. but not in Chicago in 2015,  429

You can assume that the file given will follow standard punctuation rules such as double space after a period ending a 
sentence.

***NOTE***: All programs should be able to run from a command line.
